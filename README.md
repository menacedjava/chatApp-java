<p>Chat App Java is a simple console-based client-server chat application built in Java using sockets. It demonstrates the fundamentals of real-time communication, threading, and network programming in Java. This project is ideal for beginners lookin' to understand how TCP/IP-based messaging systems work behind the scenes.</p> 
<h1>🧠Features </h1>
<p> ✅ Real-time messaging between multiple clients <br> ✅ Multithreaded server capable of handling multiple connections <br>✅ Simple text-based interface <br> ✅ Lightweight and minimal dependencies (pure Java) <br>
 ✅ Clean separation between server and client code </p>
<h1>🏗️Project Structure </h1>
<p> ↕ Server.java - Listens for incoming client connections and relays messages to all connected clients. <br>
 • Client.java - Connects to the server, sends messages, and listens for incoming messages from the server. </p>
<h1>🚀 How it works </h1>
